    Class Choice
    =============

    The player's class determines their starting stats and their deck.

    Adventurer
    Balanced deck with a mixture of abilities.


    Stats
    =====

    Strength - 
    Dexterity - 
    Intellect - 
    Vitality - 

    Stronger items tend to have stat requirements; although, they can be lowered
    by various means.

    Charges
    =========

    Some cards are limited to a number of charges. Once all the charges
    are used the card is discarded.

    Essences
    =========

    Essence cards increase stats. Only one essence card may be played before you
    take an action. Playing an essence is instant and does not take a turn.

    Campfires
    =========

    Throughout the dungeon the player will find a number of campfires. These
    should be used as places to rest and refresh their hand.

    At a campfire the player may Rest or choose to draw additional cards.

    Gold
    ====

    The player collects gold when defeating enemies and sometimes from cards.

    Some abilities and cards cost gold to use. Otherwise gold just contributes
    to the player's score.

    Treasure deck
    =============
    
    After winning an encounter the player gets to draw a single card from the
    treasure deck. This deck currently contains a random selection of good cards.
