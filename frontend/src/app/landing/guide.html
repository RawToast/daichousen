    Class Choice

    has 60 cards and when exhausted the deck will be shuffled and reset.

    Fighter
    Strength deck with a mixture of strength based abilities.

    Berserker
    Strength deck, based on using basic attack and quaffing potions.

    Chieftain
    Strength/Vitality deck using damage over time and defensive abilities.

    Rogue
    Dexterity deck with a mixture of dexterity and poison based abilities.

    Stats
    =====

    Strength - Increases attack damage
    Dexterity - Slightly increases damage, minimal increase to action speed
    Intellect - Increases magic damage and effects
    Vitality - Reduces physical damage taken

    Stronger items tend to have stat requirements; although, they can be lowered
    by certain cards.

    Skills
    =========

    Skill/Ability cards are limited to a number of charges. Once all the charges
    are used the card is discarded.

    At a campfire the player may `Learn` a skill. This is a permanent action
    which provides the following benefits:

     * The card is not discarded once all charges are used
     * Charges are refreshed upon leaving a campfire

    At the start of the game the player may learn a single skill. Every 10 Int
    an additional skill may be learned.


    Essences
    =========

    Essence cards increase stats. Only one essence card may be played before you
    take an action. Playing an essence is instant and does not take a turn.


    Campfires
    =========

    Throughout the dungeon the player will find a number of campfires. These
    should be used as places to rest and refresh their hand.

    At a campfire the player may Rest or choose to draw additional cards.

    Gold
    ====

    The player collects gold when defeating enemies and sometimes from cards.

    Some abilities and cards cost gold to use. Otherwise gold just contributes
    to the player's score.

    Treasure deck
    =============
    
    After winning an encounter the player gets to draw a single card from the
    treasure deck. This deck currently contains a random selection of good cards.
